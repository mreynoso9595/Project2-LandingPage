# Project 2 - Landing Page: NYC Travel Guide
## **Project Description**  
For this project I've built a multi-section landing page structured as a New York City travel guide. It contains four sections; Overview, Things to Do, Hotels and Dining. The inspiration behind this idea was simply me being a New Yorker who loves his hometown. I wanted to showcase the beauty of my city, which is the reason for the skyline image of NYC at the header of the landing page. I then thought what better way to make use of the sections of the page than creating a guide for tourists on what to do, and places to go in this wonderful city.

## **Usage**  
This travel guide is very intuitive. As a visitor of this travel guide you can easily scroll through the content of the page or simply click on the section you would like to skip to using the nav bar. Each section contains a brief overview of the section and what to expect in the page you will be directed to after clicking on the "Click to View" button. At the footer of the travel guide you will find links to pages where you can learn about us, contact us, view our newsletters, or view our store that contains a wide selection of cool souvenirs, gifts, and more. And don't forget to follow us on social media, you can find the links at the footer of the guide as well!

## **Dependencies**  
The three files used to build-out this project are as follows:

- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js

The file that stands out here is the javascript file. Where I've dynamically created a navigation menu, based on the sections of the page, that becomes fixed when the page is scrolled. Additionally, I added several other cool functionalities such as distinguishing the section in view, scrolling to a section on click, and hiding the fixed nav bar when the page is not being scrolled.
